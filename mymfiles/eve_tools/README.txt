Please add 'eve_tools' and all sub-directories to your path.

Before a user can make use of these tools, they must set up a special startup file named "startup_varsonly.m" somewhere on their path. Included in this folder is a template version "startup_varsonlymtemplate" that the user must fill out with the appropriate values and locations for their computer, and then rename with a *.m extension.
